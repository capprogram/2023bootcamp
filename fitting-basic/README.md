## Basic Frequentist Fitting

Updated May 2023 by S. Kannappan

This tutorial can be completed either online in a browser or locally on your own laptop. You can also get a preview of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/capprogram/2023bootcamp/blob/master/fitting-basic/FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb), but you can't interact with the preview.

To complete this tutorial ONLINE IN A BROWSER, you can use the Binder environment.
1) If you don't have Binder already loaded up, go to https://mybinder.org/ and enter the url "https://github.com/capprogram/2023bootcamp" into the github repo line and press "launch"
2) It can take up to 5 minutes to load the boot camp repo into Binder
3) After it is loaded, use the file explorer on the left to open the `FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb` file in the `fitting-basic` folder
4) You can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter. 

To complete this tutorial LOCALLY ON YOUR OWN LAPTOP, you will need to have Anaconda Python installed. (See Part I of [this tutorial](https://github.com/capprogram/2023bootcamp/blob/master/basic_data_analysis_tutorial/python-data-analysis.md).) 
1) Download the tutorial to your machine by loading [this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capprogram/2023bootcamp/master/fitting-basic/FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb) then right-clicking in the middle of the page and choosing "Save Page As" from the menu. [On Windows, change "Save as type" from "Text Document" to All Files" to preserve the ".ipynb" extension.] Save the file into the folder where you're keeping all your CAP Boot Camp work.
2) Start the Anaconda Jupyter notebook tool (Python 3 version) on your laptop. This should open up a terminal, which will in turn run the Jupyter notebook tool LOCALLY in a tab of your browser.
3) Go to that tab and navigate to the "FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb" notebook you just saved using single clicks. If it says "FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb.txt" rather than "FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb" then you did not succeed in step 1 and must find a way to rename it. (One way is to open Git Bash, navigate to the directory, and type "mv FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb.txt FrequentistFitting-Basic.ipynb".) If the file has a .ipynb extension, double-clicking on it should open it in another tab of your browser.
4) You can run or re-run individual cells in the notebook by clicking on them and typing Ctrl-Enter.
5) When you're done, optionally save and close the tutorial, then type Ctlr-C two or three times in the terminal window to terminate the Anaconda Jupyter notebook tool in the browser. The window should disappear.
