    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy debugging\n",
    "* Easy modification\n",
    "* Understandability (now, after passage of time, and to another person)\n",
    "* Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "* Plan – consider likely rate-limiting steps and best methodology before starting\n",
    "* Modularize – test subcomponents and use branches in Git\n",
    "* Check variable values, types, array sizes by hand (print statements or interrupted run)\n",
    "* Don’t assume “running” = “working”; brainstorm sanity checks\n",
    "* Use meaningful variable names (more than one letter!) that are not too similar\n",
    "* Keep standard defaults: e.g. i, j reserved for integer loop counters\n",
    "* Replace hardwired numbers with constant names at top of code or even in separate file\n",
    "* Write comments (including to bookend command sets, e.g. in if-then)\n",
    "* Take advantage of helpful visual appearance: white space, syntax highlighting\n",
    "* Avoid loops when unnecessary (possible tradeoff with understandability)\n",
    "* Manage I/O and memory; eliminate large arrays when no longer needed\n",

    "### Python-specific tips\n",
    "* don't define a function in the middle of a program, even though python lets you -- doing so muddles whether variables are defined locally or globally\n",
    "* don't use lists when you can use numpy arrays, and especially don't append elements to dynamically build lists, unless you want glacially slow code\n",
    "* pay attention to white space, it has syntactical meaning! and as a corollary, don't use tabs as white space\n",
    "* standard indentation of code levels is 4 spaces (this is a matter of preference, but standardizing is essential when collaborating)\n",
    "* protected code: it's generally a bad idea to import a script -- it will run at the time of import! you can use the \"def main\" protocol to create a \"protected\" code if you want your code to be both callable like a script and importable like a package\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slight Digression: How to Write Protected Code\n",
    "To understand how to write protected code, compare `templatecode.py` and `templatecodeprotected.py` in side-by-side Jupyter Lab windows (outside this notebook).

    "## A Little Background on the Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for fun, the code for this tutorial will explore the Central Limit Theorem by comparing Poisson distributions with Gaussian distributions. A \"distribution\" is a function giving the probabilities (plotted on the y axis) associated with different outcomes (values of x), so the whole function integrates to the sum of all possible probabilities: 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a Poisson process is counting the # of people who use the gym per hour where the count is run for a period of time nhr (set to = different times). We assume the underlying average users per hour U is fixed but the counts have \"Poisson fluctuations\" so N = nhr x U specifies the *expected* count (the mean of the theoretical Poisson distribution) not the observed count Nobs, whose possible values have different probabilities following a Poisson distribution with mean N. (In fact nhr may need to be very large for N to exactly equal Nobs, because Nobs is by definition an integer, but U is by definition a real number.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical theory tells us that for a Poisson process, the observed count Nobs fluctuates around the true theoretical mean N with a 68% confidence interval of +-sqrt(N) for \"large N\". The sleight of hand of statistics is to use the observed data to estimate N as Nobs and likewise estimate the 68% confidence interval as +-sqrt(Nobs). Thus the estimated fractional error in the count is fracerr = sqrt(Nobs)/Nobs = 1/sqrt(Nobs). The 1/sqrt explains why we get a  better estimate of U by running the count for 10 hours rather than 1 hour. However in the code we will not use data but simply compare the theoretical distributions while increasing N (or equivalently, increasing nhr).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Central Limit Theorem, as we increase N, the Poisson distribution should start to look like a Gaussian. Therefore we will plot the Poisson distribution for increasing N and overplot Gaussians with the same mean N and 68% confidence interval +-sqrt(N), to see how quickly the Poisson shape approaches a Gaussian shape (i.e., to determine when we reach the \"large N\" limit)."

Check the size and contents of the variables at each step to determine whether they make sense. Useful commands include print, len(), np.size() and .shape(). Look at the output to see if it makes sense. Just because a code stops crashing doesn't mean it is doing what you want.

    "\n",
    "We don't always want to optimize code speed -- sometimes it's just not important -- but you should be in the habit of avoiding silly things that slow your code down, like unnecessary loops or math operations. Measure the time taken by the whole template code as well as smaller parts of the template code and try to find inefficiencies. When you find a slow step, ask yourself whether it could be faster, and whether it matters (is it the rate-limiting step?). For now, fix it even if it's not the rate-limiting step, just for practice. Overall, you should be able to speed up this code by about a factor of 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two approaches to timing code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You can try using the system clock via the `time` module. The times you derive with the system clock will be affected by delays from unrelated processes running in the background, but the clock is still handy for obtaining multiple timestamps to identify the bottlenecks in your code. For example, *in the templatecodeprotected_mod.py file*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~~~\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import time\n",
    "\n",
    "    init_time = time.perf_counter()  # start clock\n",
    "    x = np.linspace(0,100,1000000)\n",
    "    y = np.sqrt(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    elap_time = time.perf_counter() - init_time  # finds difference\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Time elapsed after linspace and sqrt commands is %0.3f ms\" % (elap_time*1000))  # converts to ms\n",
    "    ~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can try using the [`%timeit`](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit) magic. `%timeit` is more accurate than the `time` module, but `%timeit` can only be used to time the entire code all at once. __You will need to import the protected version of the code if you want to run %timeit on it__, but you won't need to re-import because we set the %autoreload magic in the first cell of this notebook.
